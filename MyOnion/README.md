# MyOnion

MyOnion is a .NET 10 clean architecture reference API that demonstrates Domain-Driven Design patterns using ASP.NET Core, Mapster, a lightweight in-house mediator, FluentValidation, and EF Core. The solution is organized into Domain, Application, Infrastructure.Persistence, Infrastructure.Shared, and WebApi projects, keeping dependencies flowing inward so UI concerns never reference infrastructure details directly.

## Project Layout
- `MyOnion.Domain` - Entities, enums, shared value objects, and domain abstractions.
- `MyOnion.Application` - DTOs, Behaviours, Mapster mappings, mediator request/handler pipelines, validators, and service interfaces.
- `MyOnion.Infrastructure.Persistence` - EF Core DbContext, repositories, and seed data used to back the application layer.
- `MyOnion.Infrastructure.Shared` - Cross-cutting services (e.g., external integrations, mocks) registered for DI.
- `MyOnion.WebApi` - ASP.NET Core host exposing controllers, middleware, Swagger UI, and configuration.

For more detailed day-to-day workflow guidance (commands, linting, automation expectations), see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Repository Structure
```
MyOnion/
|-- src/        # Production projects (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, WebApi)
|-- tests/      # xUnit projects covering application, infrastructure, and API layers
|-- docs/       # Architecture plans, testing guides, and blog content
|-- scripts/    # PowerShell automation (template build/installation, VSIX packaging)
|-- artifacts/  # VSIX output and zipped templates generated by the build scripts
`-- vsix/       # VSIX project that ships the Template Onion API installer
```

## Getting Started
```powershell
# Install required SDK
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore MyOnion.sln

# Build (Release configuration recommended before PRs)
dotnet build MyOnion.sln -c Release

# Run the API with hot reload
dotnet watch run --project MyOnion.WebApi/MyOnion.WebApi.csproj
```
Navigate to `https://localhost:5001/swagger` for API exploration. Health checks are exposed at `/health`.

## Coding Standards
- Follow standard C# conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for locals/parameters, interfaces prefixed with `I`).
- Place new features under `MyOnion.Application/Features/<FeatureName>` with paired request/response handlers.
- Keep DTO names synchronized with their controller endpoints, and prefer constructor injection.
- Run `dotnet format` before submitting changes to enforce style and analyzer rules.

## Testing
Automated tests are not yet included; add future suites under `tests/` (xUnit recommended) covering validators, repositories, and controllers. Execute with `dotnet test MyOnion.sln` and collect coverage using `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` for critical features.

## Security & Configuration Notes
- JWT authentication is configured via `AddJWTAuthentication`; provide `Sts:ServerUrl`, `Sts:Audience`, and optional `Sts:ValidIssuer` via `appsettings.Development.json` or user secrets.
- Do not commit secrets. Use `dotnet user-secrets` locally or environment variables in CI/CD.
- Configure allowed front-end URLs under `Cors:AllowedOrigins` (JSON arrays) to lock down cross-origin access; fall back to the open policy only for local HTTPS development.

## Contributing
1. Fork or branch from `main`.
2. Add or update code alongside matching layer projects.
3. Validate with `dotnet build` and manual API smoke tests.
4. Submit a PR using imperative commit messages (e.g., `Add customer filtering`). Include a short description, validation commands, and screenshots or sample responses if your change alters API contracts.
5. Review [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for expanded contributor workflows, coding standards, and automation tips before opening large changes.
